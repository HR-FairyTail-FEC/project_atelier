This Hack Reactor front-end project is a multi-page ebsite simulation of e-commerce websites. Users will be able to interact with the UI and view products or services for sale. Feature highlights include adding user questions, reviews, and uploading photos using a restful API.

Given a wireframe design, our group of three software engineering students had to develop a front-end project reflecting the design and following a list of features requirements.
